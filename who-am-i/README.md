<div class="hint"> Techie: UI/UX Design, Coding, automation, Linux, and beyondâ€”constantly learning, solving, and innovating.</div>

Hi, I'm Kavindu. and in this section, I would like to keep this as an artical rather than placing my bio data and list of my skills! And to be honest it's hard to answer a quection like "Who I am?", cuz we are constantly changing over time... we grow... we learn... we fail... We won't be the same person who we was few days ago...

For now, to keep it simple, I'm just a **student** (`maybe as same as you are`) interested in how I can build / sharp the future with adding a little bit of tech and problem-solving skills. If you want this to be a bit more personal, I'm a melomaniac (music lover), a parson who pays to see others (wearing glasses ðŸ‘“), a person who cannot survive without caffeine.
